<p>
    PDT stands for Perl Development and Testing. It is a centralized P2P
    testing framework for perl. Ever have a hard time testing your module on a
    platform to which you don't have access? Ever have to wait a couple days to
    see if your locally passing tests are failing in cpan testers? Than this
    application is for you.
</p>

<p>
    This application handles perl testing in a non-passive way. Instead of
    waiting and hoping someone will test your module on an obscure platform,
    you can push your module to be tested on that platform immedietly.

<h3>How to help</h3>
<p>
    If you have access to an unusual platform, or have an excess of available
    hardware then you could really help by registering and running a host.
